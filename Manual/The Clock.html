		            <ul>
		                <li>Use the gears and knobs beneath the hinged panel to adjust the hands on the clock.
		                <li>Set the clock to the corret time and close the panel to disarm the module.
		            </ul>
		            <h3>Step A: Determine Starting Time.</h3>
		            <p>Beneath the panel at the base of the clock are two gears, and each gear has a knob at its center.  The small and large gears correspond to the hour and minute hands respectively.  Moving a gear directly will advance the corresponding hand according to its ratio.  Moving the knob on top of a gear will advance that gear's corresponding hand by <u>exactly one</u> hour or minute.
		            <p>Each of the charts on the next page simulate a clock face for the appropriate hand.  Using the features of the clock on the module, determine a straight line that travels through all appropriate categories on the chart without intersecting any others.  The hour or minute that the line lands on will provide the starting time needed to complete the module.
		            <h3>Step B: Determine Final Time.</h3>
		            <p>Follow these steps using the starting time determined in Step A.
		            <ol>
		                <li>Use the hour hand gear ratio as the tens place and the minute hand gear ratio as the ones place to create a two-digit number.  Add that many minutes.
		                <li>If the clock face is black and the number of minutes is now between twelve and one, swap the minutes and hours.
		                <li>If the color of the hour and minute hands does not match that of the numerals, subtract a number of minutes equal to twice the sum of the gear ratios.
		                <li>If the bomb has registered strikes, multiply the number of strikes by the number of D-Cell batteries on the bomb and subtract that many hours.
		                <li>If the digital countdown timer has <u>more</u> than seven (7) minutes left, add one hour.  Otherwise, if the bomb has <u>less</u> than three (3) minutes left, subtract one hour.
		                <li>Set the clock to the resulting final time after following the previous steps and close the panel.
		            </ol>
